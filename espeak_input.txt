Arriving alone on this barren wasteland, Point Man is prepared with his Holy Hand Grenade. But there is one problem, it won't leave his hand. He has a boon from God, yet the hold power makes it bound to his soul. As much as he tries, the holy hand grenade doesn't leave his hand. There are now monstrous creatures starting to appear. Point Man runs and dodges the creatures. As more and more creatures appear, it's clear that Point Man is outnumbered. The swarm continues to grow and Point Man continues to run and dodge. No matter how long this continues, Point Man remains resolute in his parkour skills. As time passes and Point Man realizes he what he has to do. He must use his Holy Hand Grenade bestowed by God to take out as many of these montsrous creatures as he possibly can. Carefully and methodically, Point Man continues to parkour as the hoard grows bigger and bigger, waiting for the perfect opportunity.
